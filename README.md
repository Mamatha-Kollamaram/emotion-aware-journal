#  Emotion-Aware Journal

Emotion-Aware Journal is a personalized journaling web app that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to detect emotions from user-written journal entries. The app helps users reflect on their emotions over time and supports emotional awareness and mental well-being.

##  Features

-  **User Authentication** via Firebase.
-  **Personalized Journal Entries** stored in Firebase Realtime Database.
-  **Emotion Detection** using a fine-tuned BERT-based uncased model from Hugging Face Transformers, trained on the **GoEmotions** dataset (Kaggle). It currently identifies **28 different emotions**.
-  **View Past Entries** along with detected emotions and dates.
-  **Delete Entries** with a single click.
-  Built with a focus on **scalability** and future enhancement of the emotion detection model.
